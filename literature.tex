To be able to do this assignment you should first read
Chap.~5, 7, 10 in \citetitle{Gollmann2011cs} \cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
Then you should read Sect.~21.3 in \citetitle{Anderson2008sea} 
\cite{Anderson2008sea}.

You should then read the classic paper \citetitle{thompson1984reflections} by 
\citet{thompson1984reflections}.
The assignment will focus on the ideas in this paper.

Although you can probably make it without knowing any assembly language in this 
assignment, it might come in handy.
So, read up on some x86-64 assembly and some tools.
For this you should read \citetitle{assembly} by \citet{assembly}.
You also need to be acquainted with some tools, for that reason, study the 
manual pages for objdump(1), as(1), and gdb(1).
