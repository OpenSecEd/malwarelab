malwarelab
===============================================================================

This is a lab assignment I developed for a course on Computer Security during 
spring 2014.  The main aim is for the student to reflect on trust and 
reproducibility of binaries from source code.

`make malware.pdf` will generate the PDF containing the instruction.
